# ðŸ¥¢ chopsticks [WIP]

an alternative cli for scoop

* we are not about to *replace* scoop, but provide an alternative cli client, and API for gophers.
* we won't handle deprecated properties
* we are using manifest schema from https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop/pull/3518, although it has not been merged yet 

## roadmap

*translate* powershell to go <- now

by 0.1.0: this would be a *could use* cli application.

by 1.0.0: refactor, all API would be stable.

more friendly user experience.
